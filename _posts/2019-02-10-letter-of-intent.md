## Hello World! 

This is my first post. How exciting! Before scheduling, I want to highlight what my posts will and will not focus on.

### Web Development

The bulk of posts will explore concepts in web development as I understand it. 
- The primary idea is to post it live where I may revisit it. As of writing this, anyone may comment either as a critique or inquiry.

- The secondary feature is for any post to be sharable via social media.

### Philosophy

There will be some posts on philosophy from time to time. Not too rigorous necessarily. 
- This is in deference to the fact that I read tons of philosophy before working as a web developer. It seems to me an ephemeral branch of study or even the only one in principle.

- I find that the systematization of one's thoughts - as is done in philosophy - is conducive to software development roles. So I won't be quitting it anytime soon.

### Science

As with philosophy, so it is with science but with one caveat: 
- I literally did quit my job in a laboratory roughly a year ago whilst pursuing a web development role. 

- While I remain enthusiastic about it in general, I could not realistically accomodate web development along with it. My discoveries lie elsewhere at the moment.

### No Politics

Although a branch of philosophy, politics is not an area that I will venture to post. 
- The political climate seems more polarizing than anytime that I can recall. More importantly, I do not find it nearly as interesting as history or comparative religion - all of which can be better evaluated by the public given the breadth of source material available.

- Dignified columnists and writers that make the work of figuring out the facts an easier and richer experience have my thanks. 

The aforemetioned points accurately describe my intent. Following the next post, expect to see more substantial content.

X&R
