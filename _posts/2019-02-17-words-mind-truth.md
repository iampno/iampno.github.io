## Introduction
Can Words Ever Establish the Mind's Arrival at Truth? It is an age old question that persists. Somtimes it is answered invariably. Other times, the form of the question itself is critiqued. Still other times, the answer is silence since any answer that could possibly be given presuposes something in the leading question itself. [Enter smart Tractatus passage on silence here] Whatever the case, we will see to what end it leads. Against better Wittgensteinian angels, the fray is entered. Some definitions are needed so as not to make the writ more cumbersome. 

## Define How One is to establish something
The question is a good example of it. To skip to the conclusion, you will find it [here]. But during the process of figuring out said conclusion, some premises were made to arrive there. Without those steps, the conclusion may scarcely seem agreeable. For anyone to establish anything, foundational ideas are laid out in anticipation of the event, which is Truth.

## And why have I defined it this way?
Why is the establishment of any class or instance defined this way?

## Also how am I using the word truth?
What is truth? We will not presume to know it. That is objective truth, which exists for some but not for others. Our interests only concern how are we using it here.

## On what fundamental grounds or reasons do I have to use truth that way?


## Only after these are answered, can one begin to respond to the question.
After some ground work like this can anyone proceed to respond.
 
// Thorough and nuanced

// Original words and examples

// Signifance of ideas are explored

// Foundational ideas are laid out

// Problems and objections are adressed as they arise
