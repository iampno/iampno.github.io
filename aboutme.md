## Prince N. Otchere

I am a developer that works for Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. Originally from Ghana. I mostly program in JavaScript but I can play around with most languages. Formerly I worked in the chemicals industry as a chemist. 

If I'm not learning a new language or technology, then I may be doing something related to science, philosophy, comparative religion or politics. Rarely, I play RPG games or watch anime but only if it relates to my interests. Shin Megami Tenei: Nocturne, Destiny, Ghost in the Shell and Gundam 00 are good examples of them.
