## Prince N. Otchere

I am currently a developer for Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. Originally from Ghana. I mostly program in JavaScript but I can play around with most languages. I usually attend [Westerville Web](https://www.meetup.com/westervilleweb/) and drop by [WestCo](https://www.westcowork.com/).

If I'm not learning a new language or technology, then I may be working on projects that either relate to my interests or evoke a sense of nostalgia. My interests fall within the areas of science, philosophy and comparative religion.


## Contact

[Email](mailto:hello@princeotchere.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iampno) are the best ways to contact me. I turn off notifications for everything else.
